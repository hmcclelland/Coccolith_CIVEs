- The files 1_carboutoc through 10_carboutoc represent 10 values for Omega calcite between 5 and 6 at aproximately 0.1 intervals.
- The files 5omega_carboutoc and 1omega_carboutoc represent specific Omega calcite values of 5 and 1 respectively. 
- Carboutal represents carbon speciation with constant alkalinity
- Carboutph represents carbon speciation with constant ph
